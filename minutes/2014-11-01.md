#Happy Hacking Club, Session 0 (The Prequel)
##Saturday, November 1st.
**Attendees: Brandy, Shea, Ryan**
  
##Topics discussed:  
  
- Format of learning  
  + We'll use [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) for the [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)/[jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery) lessons since they are concise and accessible   
- What topics to study and in what order  
  +  We'll start with the JavaScript track and work through the jQuery track and then advance to Node.js at nodeschool.io.  
- How to collaborate in IDE  
  + [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io) has a collab function so we can help each other as necessary with pair programming   
- What goals do we have?  
  + We want to start with small projects (your preference) that we build up throughout the training using the new topics we learn and eventually we'll try to collaborate on a larger group project  

##Actions taken:  
  
- Settled on Codecademy for training schedule  
- Created github Repo @ https://github.com/pixelsnbits/happyhackingclub and set to [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
- Short Intro to Nitrous IDE  
  
##General TODO:  
  
- ALL: Come up with group name, or stick with Happy Hacking Club (HHC)  
- Ryan and/or Shea: Create Instructions on how to setup Nitrous with a git repo   
- Ryan: Basic Instructions on how to checkout and contribute to common codebase via Git   
- ALL: Research discussion forum for non-instant messenging (which is not e-mail)  
- Ryan/ALL: Add dates to calendar (we may need to get future dates ironed out with [doodle.com](http://doodle.com))
  
##General Tips:  
   
- You should attempt to complete the 'Homework' before the upcoming session, if you have time. It's understood that most people don't have extra time to do that so don't worry if you're not caught up before we meet. However, things will go significantly smoother if you've at least glanced at the topics we'll be discussing and attempted to study some of the material beforehand.  
- Try and make use of the practice material every day (or when possible) and be sure to share any new sites that you find useful in the README.md (fork and merge request any changes, for now)  
- Don't worry if you get stuck on a section in a Codecademy. Try to advance as far as you can through the topic and make notes of what you don't understand and bring it to the group for discussion.  
  
#Homework before next session, tentatively ***Thursday, 11/6*** at ***7-9pm*** @ ***TBD***:
